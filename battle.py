# Battle TODO List
# 3 - On player actions, add exp to appropriate skill
# 4 - Check for skill level up on battle end
#       Check for class level up on battle end
#       Check for player level up on battle end
# 5 - Set checks for player skills to verify what skills can be used
#       Ex; Wands, staffs, and cards allow magic. Swords and axe allow brute skills. Daggers allow steal and stealth
# 6 - Thief skills need to activate when certain criteria happen
#       Pickup; Chance of items when items picked up. Exp on item acquired.
#       Accuracy; Super small boost to critical on regular hit. Exp on successful hit on enemy.
#       Critical; Boost crit damage and gains on landing critical. Exp upon critical hit.
#       Recovery; Chance to recover from miss. Exp upon miss, no recovery success required.
# 7 - Set up battle requirements (check if player or enemy are out of HP and award extras)
#       Set up turn function (player then enemy)
#       Check player equipment and set up a quick dict for available player skills
#       How to incorporate skill selection into UI? (In block or under block?)
# 8 - On player action, queue exp for when battle is over
#       Level up during run or after run?
# 9 - Set up level up notification for skills, class, and player in character module
#       Relay those into battle to notify player of changes
